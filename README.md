## 🧔‍♂️ Hi, I'm Romain MURA, another (french) web developper.
I'm actually working on a side project : [Système de jeu Zcorps pour Foundry VTT](https://github.com/piment/zcorps-foundryvtt)

Technologies I love :
- HTML/CSS
- Javascript (Vanilla, React, Vue.js, Node.js)
- SQL and NoSQL Database
- Python (and Flask)

#### 👨‍🎓 I'm currently studying FullStack development at "Wild Code School" (Toulouse, 31)

#### 👯 If you're a student too, feel free to contact me at "romain at mura dot io" if you want to collaborate on any side project.
